This hook is fired after a form submission is processed successfully, before a webhook for a form submission is sent.
It can be used to modify the webhook payload, including adding additional fields to the payload.
The hook is invoked asynchronously by the Wirechunk job worker, so there is no site or principal field in the context object.
